#### A repository with the latest gubbins from the community edition of the 2013 Source SDK, plus any changes I make.

Current changes:

- Added a new weapon, the "Nullifactor" from P2CE
- Re-enabled jeep and jeep headlights
- Added AI relationships from HL2
- Deaths are now viewed in first person for a few seconds before switching to third-person again
- Upped projected texture limit to 8
- Projected textures can use a resolution larger than the screen
- Projected textures can actually have a custom texture (lives up to the name)
- Visual shader editor (run with `-shaderedit`)
- Glowing outline effect can be applied to any subclass of CBaseAnimating
- Implemented a few ambient_generic fixes from the VDC
