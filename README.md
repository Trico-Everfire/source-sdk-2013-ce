#### A repository with the latest gubbins from the community edition of the 2013 Source SDK, plus any changes I make.

Current changes:
- Switched to MP branch only
- Re-enabled physgun
- Added a new weapon, the "Nullifactor" from P2CE (WIP, need to code the proper effect)
- Re-enabled jeep headlights (WIP, still need to get jeeps to spawn)
- Added AI relationships from HL2
- Deaths are now viewed in first person for a few seconds before switching to third-person again
- Upped projected texture limit to 8
- Projected textures can use a resolution larger than the screen
- Projected textures can actually have a custom texture (lives up to the name)
- Visual shader editor (run with `-shaderedit`)
